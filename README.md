# SciAstra-Education-Web-Development-Internship
It is an Internship assignment
Creating this platform involves several stages, from frontend design to backend functionality and integration. I'll provide you with an outline for each component and sample code snippets to help you build the application.

Here's an overview of the structure:

Frontend Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
Backend and API (Node.js + Express)
Database (MySQL)
Course Purchase Flow
Blog Management
Frontend Code:
This includes a responsive interface with sections for discounted courses, blog management, and course purchase.

index.html (Dynamic Homepage for Courses)

2. Backend API and Database Setup

dbConfig.js (Database Configuration for MySQL)
3. Course Purchase Flow and Payment
payment.html (Mock Payment Page)
4. Blog Management with Scheduling
Blog posts can be scheduled with a date and time for release. The following script helps manage that.

blogRoutes.js (Routing for Blog Management)
5. Database Setup
Use MySQL to create tables:

This code setup includes essential features and demonstrates how different parts of the application work together. You can record the final flow, showing how the courses appear dynamically, blog posts can be managed, and the dummy payment flow for the course purchase process.
